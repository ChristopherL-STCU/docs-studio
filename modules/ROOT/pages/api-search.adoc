= Search Inside Your API Specification Dependencies

When you use Anypoint Studio 7.4 to import your API specifications from Exchange or Maven as dependencies of your project, those dependencies relocate from`src/resources/api/` to a ZIP file in your project's classpath. This change means that you cannot search for your API dependencies by using the File Search option in Studio. To enable you to search for specific text inside your API dependencies, Studio introduces the API Search feature.

You can access the API Search menu from the taskbar at the top of the Anypoint Studio display, either by selecting *Search* > *Search...* or by using the control and H keys on your keyboard simultaneously:

. Type the text that you want to search inside your API dependencies. +
* Use `\*` to search for any string. For example, `*-api-*` searches for strings containing `-api-`.
* Use `?` to allow any character after a specific pattern. For example, `customer?` searches for both `customer` and `customers`.
* Use `\` to escape any of the reserved literals used in search patterns. For example, if you want to search for strings containing `\*`, `?`, or `\` you must escape them: `\*`, `\?`, and `\\`.
. If you want to specify a specific name pattern for the files you want to search through, type the pattern in the *File name patterns* field.
+
* Use `\*` to search for any string. For example, `*-api-*` searches inside any API specification containing `-api-` in its name.
* Use `?` to allow any character after a specific pattern. For example, `customer?.raml` searches inside both `customer.raml` and `customers.raml`.
* Use `!` to exclude certain filenames or patterns. For example, `!examples.raml` searches inside all files except `examples.raml`.
. Click the *Choose...* button to filter per file type.
. Select the type of API specification in your project.
+
* *API dependencies* searches inside API specifications imported from Exchange or Maven.
* *Local API Files* searches inside API specifications added from a local file or Design Center.

When you click *Search* Studio searches for your text criteria inside your API specifications.

You can also search for all API specifications inside your open projects by selecting *Navigate* > *Open API Resource* in the taskbar at the top of the Anypoint Studio display, or by using the `cmd + Shift + P` (OSx) or `control + shift + P` (Windows/Linux) keyboard shortcut.

Anypoint Studio 7.2 and later simplifies the configuration of the `mule-artifact.json` file. This file is used when packaging your Mule application to identify its class loader configuration and settings, and the minimum required Mule runtime engine version to run your application.

Anypoint Studio includes a new version of the Mule Maven Plugin that can automatically infer some of this required metadata. This makes it easier for you to keep track of all the declarations you need to make when exporting resources.

Note that this simplification is meant to reduce the number of declarations you need to monitor during development. A fully configured `mule-artifact.json` file is still required by Mule runtime engine when executing the packaged application. You can find the generated `mule-artifact.json` file inside the `target` directory after packaging.

The plugin inspects the metadata declared in `mule-artifact.json`. If there is a value that is not declared, the plugin infers it from the application code before packaging. If other metadata is declared, the plugin uses that information to package the application.

If you choose to update to the latest plugin and want to keep your old descriptor files, you'll need to manually keep track of your descriptor metadata.


== Upgrading from Studio 7.1.x to 7.2 and later

When you open Anypoint Studio 7.2 and use a workspace created with previous versions, Studio pops up a note:

image::this-766bb.png[align=center]

Note that Studio lists only the projects whose configurations need updating; it does not list closed projects.

Clicking *Perform update* enables Studio to:

* Update the Mule Maven Plugin version in the pom.xml file of your projects listed in this dialog.
* Remove all declarations from the `mule-artifact.json` files of the same listed projects. +
This process overwrites your existing `mule-artifact.json` file. If you have other declarations in `mule-artifact.json` that you want to preserve (for example, `secureProperties`, `redeploymentEnabled`, and so on), you should back up those files outside of your workspace, perform the migration, and then restore your old `mule-artifact.json` files.


Do not to preserve the following declarations:

** `configs`
** `name`
** `requiredProduct`
** `classLoaderModelLoaderDescriptor`
** `bundleDescriptorLoader`

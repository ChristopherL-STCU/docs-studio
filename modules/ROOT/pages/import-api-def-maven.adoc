Anypoint Studio allows you to import an API Definition in a Maven repository and implement it either into a new Mule Project, or into an existing one.

This feature is possible through API Sync. If you are using an older version of Mule Runtime (4.1.3 and below), or if you don't want to use this new design paradigm and would still prefer to import an API definition that's not in Exchange, follow the xref:studio::import-api-def-dc.adoc[Importing an API Definition from a Local File] steps.

== Implementing an API Into a New Project

. Click File > New > Mule Project to create a project, and set the field values in the project wizard:
+
. Type a name for your project.
. Select a Mule runtime version 4.1.4 or later.
. Check the *API Implementation* checkmark.
. In the *Add API Specification Dependency* tab, click the plus icon, and select *From Maven*
. You can specify your API definition's Maven coordinates, or you can install a local file into your Maven repository.

=== Installing a Local File

. In the Import from Maven screen, next to the *Install a local dependency* field, click *Install*.

. In the *File* field, you can type the destination to your file, or click *Browse* to browse through your files. +
If you select *Browse*, make sure you change the file type to *any*. +
You can add a ZIP bundle file as your API definition and click *Open*.
. Set up the rest of your Maven coordinates for your API artifact, and make sure that your classifier is the same as your API definition type (RAML, for example).
. Click *Install*, and *OK*.
. Anypoint Studio asks you if you want to scaffold your API specification.

== Implementing an API from Exchange Into an Existing Project

. Select your project from the Package Explorer view.
. Click the API Sync icon on the top menu bar.

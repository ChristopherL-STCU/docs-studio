To support some of Studio Themes in Linux, it is recommended to have GTK version 2 installed.

* Before downloading and launching Anypoint Studio, make sure you have the Java SE JDK 8 installed.

To install Anypoint Studio:

. Download Anypoint Studio from the https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/studio[Anypoint Studio Download Site] and extract it.
. Open the extracted Anypoint Studio.
. Click OK to accept the default workspace. +
When setting a custom path to your workspace, keep in mind that Anypoint Studio does not expand the `~` tilde used in Unix/Linux systems. It is recommended to use the absolute path when defining your workspace.

If you choose to use an existing workspace, this must have been created using Anypoint Studio 7.0 or above.

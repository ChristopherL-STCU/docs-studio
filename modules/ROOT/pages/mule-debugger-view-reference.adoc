This section contains a full description of the Mule Debugger View and all its available tools.

When the Mule Debugger starts, it points at the running Mule Runtime in Studio and waits for the Mule Event to reach its first active breakpoint. +
Until then, the Mule Debugger View displays a placeholder message:

When the Mule Event stops at a Breakpoint, the Mule Debugger View displays information about the state of the Mule Event at that breakpoint:

To see any nested elements for a property, click the arrow next to the property name.

You can interact with your inspected element by right-clicking the element on your debugger view to display a contextual menu.

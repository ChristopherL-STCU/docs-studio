Anypoint Studio allows you to import an API specification into either a new Mule Project, or an existing one.

This feature is possible through API Sync. If you are using an older version of Mule Runtime (4.1.3 and below), or if you would still prefer to import an API specification that's not in Exchange, follow the xref:studio::import-api-specification-design-center.adoc[Importing an API Specification from a Local File] steps.

== Importing an API from Exchange Into a New Project

. In the top task bar, select *File*, then *New*, and then *Mule Project*.
. Type a name for your project.
. Select a Mule runtime engine version 4.1.4 or later.
. In the *API Specification* section, select the *From Exchange or Maven* tab.
. Click the *Add* icon (image:add-icon.png[2%,2%]), and select *From Exchange*.

If you are not logged in, you can click the *Add Account* button to add your Anypoint Platform account.
. From the list of available APIs, select the one you want and click the *Add* button to add it to your project. +

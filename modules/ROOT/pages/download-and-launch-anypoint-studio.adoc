== Installing Enterprise Modules

If you are running *Anypoint Studio* with *Mule Enterprise Edition (EE)*, you can add additional modules to your Studio instance.

* xref:3.8@mule-runtime::installing-anypoint-enterprise-security.adoc[Anypoint Enterprise Security]

* xref:3.8@mule-runtime::anypoint-connectors.adoc[Anypoint Connectors]

* mailto:sales@mulesoft.com[Contact MuleSoft] to acquire entitlements to access the xref:3.8@mule-runtime::mulesoft-enterprise-java-connector-for-sap-reference.adoc[SAP Connector] and/or xref:3.8@mule-runtime::mule-high-availability-ha-clusters.adoc[High Availability Clustering]

== Updating Studio

Anypoint Studio notifies you when an update is available.

[TIP]
You can also check this manually going to *Help* > *Check for Updates*.

Keep in mind that updating your Studio installation to the latest release using this method does not update the bundled Runtime version that's announced in the xref:release-notes::studio/anypoint-studio.adoc[release notes].

If you updated Studio from the update site and want to get the announced runtime version bundled with your version of Studio follow these steps:

. Go to *Help* > *Install New Software ...*.
. In the _Work with_ drop down menu select *Anypoint Studio Update Site*.
. Expand the *Anypoint Studio* entry.
. Select the *Mule Server Runtime {version}* that appears listed.
. Follow the instructions on screen to complete the installation.

Anypoint Studio allows you to import an API Definition from Exchange and implement it either into a new Mule Project, or an existing one.

This feature is possible through API Sync. If you are using an older version of Mule Runtime (4.1.3 and below), or if you don't want to use this new design paradigm and would still prefer to import an API definition that's not in Exchange, follow the xref:studio::import-api-def-dc.adoc[Importing an API Definition from a Local File] steps.

== Implementing an API Into a New Project

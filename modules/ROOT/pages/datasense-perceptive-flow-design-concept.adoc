Perceptive Flow Design is an Anypoint Studio functionality that lets you visualize the mapping of data from one data format and structure to another.

== Purpose of Perceptive Flow Design

Mule 4 introduces a prescriptive way to build reliable and reusable flow artifacts and apps. You can build, for example, more reliable applications by achieving earlier detection of errors during design time. To make this feature possible without changing runtime semantics, Mule 4 uses metadata. Metadata should act as a prescriptive guidance to build more reliable and reusable applications.

=== Example: Using Datasense for Data Mapping

Consider a flow in which you included an Anypoint Connector that's preceded or followed by a Transform Message component. The Mule runtime engine uses the working connection to the resource to retrieve metadata about the payload and properties, and feeds this data into DataWeave providing the expected input or output, avoiding you the trouble to manually inspect the Mule event's structure.

For example, imagine that you need to connect your organization's Salesforce account to Slack to notify your team about a new opportunity. By dropping both Salesforce and Slack connectors on your Studio canvas, and configuring them to connect to your organization's accounts, you can then drop a Transform Message component between the connectors and notice that Mule captures the data type and structure information from each provider, and prescribes the input and output for your data mapping. With the prescription in place, you can configure the mapping, filling in the blanks of the DataWeave code.

=== Example: Using Datasense for Autocomplete

Imagine you are obtaining status update data from the Slack connector and that you want to log the message you are sending to Slack, but you aren't familiar with the property names used by this connector. Instead of having to look up Slack's documentation to find out the name of the property you need, you can just place a Logger message processor right after the Slack connector and write in it. If you start writing `#[payload.` in the logger's Message field, and then press `ctrl + space bar`, you get a list of all the properties and methods associated to the payload, including the properties returned by the request that you're performing on the Slack connector.

== Specifically Declaring Metadata

All components in a Mule application let you manually define the metadata that they expose. When building prescriptive and reusable components in a flow, you need to pay attention when to let Datasense handle the metadata that a component expects, and when you need to manually define a metadata that a component should expect or expose.

We recommend you to specifically declare metadata only when:

* It is absolutely required, for example, metadata for a value being defined by you.
* When it is most cohesive to an annotated value, for example, when metadata for a value is being used or expected by a component.

For example, the Transform Message component should not define a metadata contract because Dataweave acts as a data mediation device between the producer and consumer of data. Those boundaries are the ones that should define the contracts. By explicitly declaring a metadata type, you are masking the actual metadata type of the data coming out from your Transform Message component. The DataWeave implementation within the Transform Message component can completely infer this output data type. The best practice is to define expected metadata where this data is used or consumed, and it is not automatically inferred. At the same time, defining the input metadata for your Transform Message component also masks the actual incoming metadata coming into your Transform Message component to be used on mapping. It would be best to define metadata where data is produced, and again, only when it is not automatically inferred.

Additionally, whenever data lives outside the scope of a reusable artifact, you should declare its metadata as part of that component's contract. Flows and subflows, for example, need to declare their metadata contract, just like any other processor would. You should declare your input and output metadata specifying the shape of event you require, and the shape of the event you return to the caller. Output event declaration, if not specified, is automatically inferred from flow content when the flow is not recursive.

If you declare a Flow Reference component that points to another flow with a Set Payload component right after an HTTP Listener source, the Set Payload component throws an `Unable to resolve reference` error.

To solve this error, you need to define the expected input metadata, which is the `HttpRequestAttributes` class from the Mule runtime engine.

. In your *Set Variable* properties view, click the *Metadata* tab.
. Click the *Add metadata* button, and select *input: Attributes* from the drop-down menu.

. Click the `edit` icon.

. In the new pop-up window, click *New*, and enter a type ID. For example, `httpObject`.
. Select your newly created type ID.
. Select *Object* from the *Type* drop-down menu, and select *Class* as your object type.
. Click the *Click here to select an option* message, and select *Java object*.

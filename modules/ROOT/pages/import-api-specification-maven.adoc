= Importing an API Specification from Maven
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

Anypoint Studio allows you to import an API specification in a Maven repository into a new Mule Project, or an existing one.

This feature is possible through API Sync. If you are using an older version of Mule Runtime (4.1.3 and below), or if you don't want to use this new design paradigm and would still prefer to import an API specification that's not in Exchange, follow the xref:studio::import-api-specification-design-center.adoc[Importing an API Specification from a Local File] steps.

== Importing an API From Maven Into a New Project

. In the top task bar, select *File*, then *New*, and then *Mule Project*.
. Type a name for your project.
. Select a Mule runtime engine version 4.1.4 or later.
. In the *API Specification* section, select the *From Exchange or Maven* tab, click the plus icon, and select *From Maven*. +
You can either specify the Maven coordinates of your API specification, or you can install a local file into your Maven repository.

=== Adding Your API From Maven Coordinates

If your API specification is in your corporate's Maven repository, you can add it as a dependency.

. In the *Import From Maven* screen, configure your API specification artifact definition:
* Group ID.
* Artifact ID.
* Version.
. In the *Advanced Settings* section, make sure that the *Classifier* of your dependency is the same as your API specification type (RAML, for example).
. Click *OK*.

Studio scaffolds your API specification. If you choose not to create flows out of your API specification, uncheck the *Scaffold Flows From These API Specifications* option.

You can manage the API specifications in your project that are linked to Exchange from the API Project management view by clicking the *Manage Mule Project APIs* icon (image:manage-project-api-icon.png[2%,2%]) in the top task bar.

=== Adding Your API From a Local File

If you can't connect to the internet to download the API specification dependency from your corporate Maven repository, or if your API specification is not available in Maven, you can still make your specification available as a dependency by installing it to your local Maven installation:

. In the *Import From Maven* screen, next to the *Install a local dependency* field, click *Install*.
. In the *File* field, you can type the destination to your file, or click *Browse* to browse through your files. +
If you select *Browse*, make sure you change the file type to *any*. +
You can add a ZIP bundle file as your API specification and click *Open*.
. Set up the rest of your Maven coordinates for your API artifact.
. In the *Advanced Settings* section, make sure that the *Classifier* of your dependency is the same as your API specification type (RAML, for example).
. Click *Install*, and *OK*.

Studio scaffolds your API specification. If you choose not to create flows out of your API specification, uncheck the *Scaffold Flows From These API Specifications* option.

You can manage the API specifications in your project that are linked to Exchange from the API Project management view by clicking the *Manage Mule Project APIs* icon (image:manage-project-api-icon.png[2%,2%]) in the top task bar.

== Importing an API from Maven Into an Existing Project

. Select your project from the Package Explorer view.
. Click the *Add* icon (image:add-icon.png[2%,2%]), and select *From Maven*.
. You can specify your API specification's Maven coordinates, or you can install a local file into your Maven repository.

. Edit the startup file (~/.bashrc).
. Modify PATH variable. +
Make sure that the JDK /bin directory of the version you want to configure is the first item in your PATH environment variable. The example below configures JDK 1.8:
+
[source,console,linenums]
----
PATH=/usr/local/jdk1.8.0/bin:$PATH
export PATH
----
+
. Save and close the file.
. Load the startup file.
+
[source,console,linenums]
----
> . /.profile
----

To verify that your installation was configured correctly, type:

[source,console,linenums]
----
> java -version
----

This should print the version of the java tool. +
If the version is other than your desired JDK, or you get the error "java: Command not found", then the JDK is not properly installed.

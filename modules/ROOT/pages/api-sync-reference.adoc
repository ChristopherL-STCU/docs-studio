API Sync lets you pull an API definition published in Exchange, and scaffold a flow out of this file. +
Additionally, you can use API Sync to keep track of the API versions that you implemented, and update your flows based on the latest published version.

== Prerequisites

API Sync comes bundled by default in Studio 7.4.x and later, and requires Mule 4.1.4 or later. +

== Creating a New Project with API Sync

. Create an API Definition in Design Center and publish it to Exchange. +
Follow any of these instructions to xref:design-center::design-create-publish-api-visual-editor.adoc[Create and Publish an API Specification with the Visual Editor in Design Center] or xref:design-center::design-create-publish-api-raml-editor.adoc[Create and Publish an API Specification with the Code Editor in Design Center].
. Import this API Definition from Exchange to your Studio project.
xref:studio::import-api-definition.adoc[Importing an API Definition from Exchange].

== Updating the API Version

API Sync does not automatically check for newer versions of the APIs you implemented from Exchange. +
To check for updates:

. Right click in the project that implements the API for which you want to check for updates.
. From the *API Specs* menu, select the API for which you want to check for updates, and click *Check for updates*.

If a new version is found, API Sync asks you if you want to regenerate the flows based on the new version.

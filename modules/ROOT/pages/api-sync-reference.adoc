API Sync lets you pull a published API definition from Exchange, and scaffold a flow in a new Mule application project in Studio. +
Additionally, you can use API Sync to keep track of the API versions that you implemented and update your flows based on the latest published version.

You can use API Sync on more than one API Specification to scaffold multiple flows in different Mule configuration files.

API Sync comes bundled by default in Studio 7.4.x and later, and requires Mule 4.1.4 or later.

API Sync helps you to develop your Mule applications following our recommended API Lifecycle practices. +
The following steps are our recommended approach to an API lifecycle development using API Sync:

. Create an API Definition in Design Center and publish it to Exchange. +
Follow any of these instructions to xref:design-center::design-create-publish-api-visual-editor.adoc[Create and Publish an API Specification with the Visual Editor in Design Center] or xref:design-center::design-create-publish-api-raml-editor.adoc[Create and Publish an API Specification with the Code Editor in Design Center].
. Import this API Definition from Exchange to your Studio project.
xref:studio::import-api-definition.adoc[Importing an API Definition from Exchange].

Currently, it is not possible to create a new API version from Studio, and then upload that new version to Exchange. +
We recommend changing your API specification in Design Center, then publish a new version to Exchange, and updating your local Studio implementation using API Sync:

. Right click in the project that implements the API for which you want to check for updates.
. From the *API Specs* menu, select the API for which you want to check for updates, and click *Check for updates*.

If a new version is found, API Sync asks you if you want to regenerate the flows based on the new version.


[CAUTION]
--
API sync feature might not work properly if the RAML file exceeds 4,000 lines of text.
--

Studio 7.4 does not allow you to import an API specification directly from Design Center, as older versions used to do. +
If you don't want to publish your API spec to Exchange, you need to download the API from Design Center and import it as a local file to your Studio project. +
Follow the xref:studio::import-api-def-dc.adoc[Importing an API Definition from a Local File] steps for more information.
